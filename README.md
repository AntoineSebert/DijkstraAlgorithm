# Dijkstra Algorithm

## Abstract

The aim of this header-only library is to provide a simple C++17 implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. It is based on a fibonacci heap to efficiently store the data, and prevent memory leaks with the use of smart pointers. It is also possible to run multiple Dijkstra's algorithm at the same time.

## Features

 - create an object represnetation of the algorithm
 - create the nodes & paths representing the graph
 - collect the results

## Implementation

Simply add the library to your project using `#include "dijkstra.hpp"`
